# Fluster GitHub Organization
Welcome to the Fluster GitHub Organization. This space is dedicated to the development, refinement, and continuous improvement of the Fluster app—a safe, user-centered platform designed for roleplaying without the distractions.

Here, we maintain an open, semi-public space for contributors and developers alike to collaborate on core features, bug fixes, and feature requests. Whether you’re here to report an issue, propose enhancements, or contribute code, we’re all working towards the same goal: creating a seamless and secure experience for every user.

## Key Aspects:
Public Projects: Open to contributions from developers who align with Fluster’s vision for a clean, efficient, and inclusive platform.

Semi-Open Collaboration: Contributions are welcomed with an understanding of the importance of maintaining a balanced, safe, and organized space.

Transparency & Quality: As part of the open-source ethos, the goal is to provide a clear view into the app’s development while ensuring the code stays clean, maintainable, and free from unnecessary distractions.

If you’re here to help make Fluster even better, we’re thrilled to have you. Let’s build something amazing, together.
